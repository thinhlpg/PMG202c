## Four Agile Values

1. **Individuals and Interactions Over Processes and Tools**

	- Agile emphasizes the importance of people communicating with each other rather than relying solely on processes and tools.
	- Collaboration and teamwork are key, valuing individual perspectives and creativity.
	- Example: Avi speaks regularly with the baristas at Family Java to learn how the company’s app is working to provide accurate customer orders. Although there is a formal process for baristas to submit issues, Avi values his interactions with them, learning how the app impacts their day-to-day work and collaborating on what updates are important.
2. **Working Software Over Comprehensive Documentation**

	- Prioritizing the creation of value by working on the product itself rather than spending excessive time on documentation.
	- Applicable to various projects, where delivering the desired product takes precedence over detailed documentation.
	- Example: Family Java considers its app to be ever-evolving. Initially, customers could only order drinks, but over time, the company added new features like a rewards program. Avi ==documents these updates in simple spec sheets for each feature release rather than creating multiple, detailed documents for each new feature request==.
3. **Customer Collaboration Over Contract Negotiation**

	- Customer satisfaction is the top priority for Agile projects, focusing on building high-quality, valuable products.
	- Emphasizes collaboration with customers early and often, allowing quick adaptation to their needs without lengthy contract negotiations.
	- Example: Rather than enter into agreements with market research companies, Avi loves to come into the shop to test features of the app with actual customers. Family Java typically prefers this in-the-moment type of interaction to collect feedback.
4. **Responding to Change Over Following a Plan**

	- Acknowledges the inevitability of change in projects, emphasizing the need to adapt.
	- Agile project managers value plans but are flexible and able to adapt when changes are necessary during the project.
	- Example: Family Java ==built a feedback mechanism into its app, but customers prefer to post their opinions on social media instead==. Here, customers organically formed a Family Java community online. The company didn’t anticipate this, but now its baristas and project managers frequently join the conversation and respond to feedback, quickly and easily.

## Agile Effort Estimation Techniques

Generally speaking, the main steps to Agile estimation are the same, even if the specific approach varies. Some examples of Agile estimation techniques are: 

- Planning Poker™
- Dot Voting
- The Bucket System
- Large/Uncertain/Small
- Ordering Method
- Affinity Mapping

### **1. Planning Poker™:**

- **Purpose:** Used for small item estimates (under 10).
- **Process:**
	- Each team member has a deck of cards with Fibonacci sequence numbers.
	- Cards may include coffee cups (need a break) and question marks (lack understanding).
	- During Sprint Planning, team members lay down cards for each item simultaneously.
	- Discussion ensues for disparate estimates to achieve consensus.

### **2. Dot Voting:**

- **Suitability:** Effective for sprints with a low number of items.
- **Execution:**
	- Team members use color-coded dot stickers based on effort (e.g., S=green, M=blue).
	- Items placed around a table; team members add stickers to items.
	- Quick and visual method for estimating.

### **3. Bucket System:**

- **Scalability:** Efficient for backlogs with numerous items.
- **Procedure:**
	- Metaphorical "buckets" of complexity are predetermined.
	- Each item is placed on a note card; team members randomly draw and place items along a complexity line.
	- Quick placement with minimal discussion, promoting efficiency.

### **4. Large/Uncertain/Small:**

- **Applicability:** Suitable for comparable items in product backlogs.
- **Implementation:**
	- Three categories: large, uncertain, small.
	- Starting with simpler stories, team assigns items to categories.
	- Gradual discussion and placement of more complex items.

### **5. Ordering Method:**

- **Ideal for:** Smaller teams with a large number of backlog items.
- **Execution:**
	- Scale prepared; items randomly placed from low to high.
	- Each team member adjusts item positions or passes their turn.
	- Continues until team members no longer want to move items.

### **6. Affinity Mapping:**

- **For Teams with:** More than 20 items in the product backlog.
- **Process:**
	- Sticky notes represent user stories; placed on a wall or board.
	- Team groups items based on similarity, creating 3-10 thematic groups.
	- Groups prioritized by importance for targeted tackling.

### **Characteristics Of Effective Estimation:**

- **Avoids False Precision:**
	- Emphasizes relative estimates over precise figures.
	- Saves time and enhances accuracy across the project.
- **Mitigates Anchoring Bias:**
	- Keeps initial estimates private to prevent bias.
	- Allows independent opinions before sharing thoughts.
- **Promotes Inclusivity:**
	- Fosters trust and cohesiveness within the team.
	- Group estimation techniques lead to better estimates.
- **Facilitates Effort Discovery:**
	- Dynamic estimation uncovers strategies for completion.
	- Reveals insights that may remain hidden otherwise.

## Scrum Pillars: Foundation of Agile Empiricism

### **2. Foundations of Scrum: Empiricism:**

- **Scientific Theory - Empiricism:**
	- True knowledge derived from actual, lived experience.
	- Decision-making based on real experience and hard data.

### **3. Empiricism Pillars: Transparency, Inspection, Adaptation:**

- **Transparency:**
	- Making significant aspects of work visible to those responsible.
	- Critical within Scrum Teams and extended to stakeholders for trust and collaboration.
	- Example: At the Daily Standup, an animator shares that their productivity has slowed because they do not have the right computer to render their videos. As Scrum Master, you gather information about the issue and go to your technology partner to discuss how to resolve the problem together.
- **Inspection:**
	- Conducting timely checks towards Sprint goal outcome.
	- Stakeholder reviews as opportunities for growth and progress.
	- Example: At the Sprint Review, the team demonstrates their progress on a scene for the studio manager, who has invited the film’s special effects director to observe their processes and give feedback. The special effects director suggests three new ideas for the scene.
- **Adaptation:**
	- Continuously searching for ways to adjust project, product, or processes.
	- Embracing change for continuous improvement.
	- Example: At the Sprint Retrospective, you ask the team to come up with one idea around their scene production processes to improve their efficiency.

### **4. Importance of Empiricism:**

- **Continuous Improvement:**
	- Iterations and increments as mini-experiments for valuable learning.

## **Understanding Burndown Charts and Velocity in Scrum**

In this video, we delve into two pivotal concepts for effective Scrum Team management throughout a Sprint and across the entire Product Backlog: **Burndown Charts** and **Velocity**.

### **Burndown Charts:**

![[Burndown chart.png]]

A burndown chart serves to measure time against the work completed and remaining. It enables the team to track their progress against overall goals, specifically focusing on completing user stories during the Sprint. The Scrum Master regularly reviews the burndown chart to assess the team's trajectory towards their Sprint goals.

- **Calculation Example:**
	- Virtual Verde team's Sprint: 4 weeks (20 business days)
	- Sprint Backlog: 200 points
	- Expected daily burn: 10 points
	- Day 5: 22 points burned (25% completion)
	- Day 10: 45 points burned (45% completion)
	- Day 15: 140 points burned (70% completion)
	- Day 20: 188 points burned (94% completion)

### **Velocity:**

Velocity represents the average number of points a team completes during a single Sprint. When planning, teams use their average velocity over several Sprints to determine how many items they can confidently add to their Sprint Backlog.

- **Key Points:**
	- No "good" or "bad" velocity; it reflects historical team achievements.
	- Each team has a unique velocity based on their point system calibration.
	- Stable velocity unlocks the ability to predict when the entire Product Backlog will be completed and how much can be achieved by a specific time.
- **Example Scenario:**
	- Virtual Verde team's average monthly velocity: 200 points
	- Remaining Product Backlog: 1500 points
	- Prediction: Approximately 7-8 Sprints needed to complete the backlog.

### **Predictive Power:**

The ability to confidently predict completion timelines and the amount of backlog completed is a potent Agile and Scrum tool. It empowers teams to make informed decisions, such as adjusting priorities or team size.

- **Empowering Stakeholders:**
	- Stakeholders can be informed of when the entire Product Backlog will be completed.
	- Predictions enable planning for specific dates and making critical project decisions.

## **Interpreting Velocity: Dos and Don'ts**

In the previous video, we defined **velocity** as “The measure of how many points the team burns down in a given Sprint on average.” Velocity is a crucial metric in Agile, providing insights into a team's capacity and performance. However, there are important considerations when interpreting and using velocity. Let's explore the dos and don'ts.

### **Calculating Velocity:**

Estimating effort is done using various units, commonly **story points** or **T-shirt sizes**, calibrated and decided on by the team. When using T-shirt sizes, teams map sizes to numeric values for calculating velocity.

- **Initial Sprint Estimation:**
	- In the first Sprint, teams make a rough guess to get started.
	- After a few Sprints, teams establish a reliable velocity, used for Sprint Backlog planning during backlog refinement.

### **Using Velocity for Good:**

When interpreting velocity, certain practices can enhance its effectiveness.

- **Do: Be careful when sharing velocity with external stakeholders:**
	- Velocity is team-specific; external stakeholders may lack context.
	- Share supporting materials, date ranges, and visualizations for better interpretation.
	- Trends in velocity provide insights and encourage improvements.

### **Avoiding Pitfalls:**

While velocity is a valuable tool, it should not be misused or misunderstood.

- **Don't: Use velocity as a performance metric:**
	- Avoid quantifying team performance with velocity.
	- Pressure based on velocity can harm team culture and foster intimidation tactics.
- **Don't: Use velocity as a comparison metric:**
	- Comparing teams solely based on velocity is misleading.
	- Story point weights are subjective; judging productivity by velocity is neither accurate nor fair.
	- Velocity is not a measure of value; variability is acceptable as long as both teams deliver value.
- **Do: Proceed with caution when using velocity for project delivery date:**
	- Velocity can be misused as a pressure point for setting product launch dates.
	- False expectations and a competitive culture may arise if estimated dates are not met.
	- Projecting deliverable dates can be harmful; teams need time to understand their capabilities across multiple Sprints.
	- Changes and issues may arise, making it challenging to commit to mapped-out dates in advance.

## **Understanding Kanban and Scrum Boards**

In the last video, we emphasized the importance of visualizing progress through **burndown charts**.

### **1. Designing the Plays**

- **Collaborative Playbook Creation:** Although the Scrum Master owns the playbook, it's crucial to involve the entire team in its creation. The playbook should encompass the team's approach to Sprint Reviews, day-to-day operations, and communication with stakeholders. Decisions regarding updates to plays should be a team effort, ensuring everyone understands and contributes to the flow.
- **Example:** Facilitate brainstorming sessions to identify process inefficiencies. Prioritize improvement ideas collectively, fostering a sense of ownership and commitment to the playbook.

### **2. Providing Feedback**

- **Timely Guidance:** Just as a sports coach provides directions from the sidelines during a game, the Scrum Master needs to offer continuous guidance. Timely feedback, both positive and constructive, should be a daily practice. Additionally, adopt a big-picture view to identify patterns and areas for improvement, akin to a coach reviewing game footage.
- **Highlight Successes:** Feedback isn't solely about fixing issues. Acknowledge and emphasize processes and activities that are effective. Encourage the team to continue employing successful strategies and practices.

### **3. Celebrating and Learning**

- **Acknowledge Success:** Regularly congratulate the team on achievements, successful customer interactions, or significant solution launches. Positive reinforcement fosters a motivated and engaged team.
- **Turning Losses into Opportunities:** In instances where the team faces challenges or falls short of a requirement, treat it as critical data for improvement. Emphasize the importance of learning from setbacks and maintaining a positive outlook. As Thomas Edison said, "I have not failed—I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."
