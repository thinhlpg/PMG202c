## **Case Study - The Significance of Each Project Phase**

**Introduction:**

- Jason, a project manager in virtual reality software, receives an urgent request for a training program proposal.
- Rushed proposal leads to reprimand and project failure before starting.

**Consequences of Rushing:**

- Proposal hastily estimated at $200,000 and six weeks.
- Engineers discover platform incompatibility, requiring six months of development and testing, costing over a million dollars.
- Project fails due to impacts on budget, quality, and timeline.

**Recommended Approach:**

- Jason proposes taking more time to create an accurate proposal.
- Flight Simulators, Inc. appreciates the communication and grants a week for a detailed estimate.
- Jason involves key players to assess effort, cost, schedule, and resources.

**Applying Project Life Cycle:**

**1. Initiating the Project:**

- **Rushed Scenario:** Jason quickly defines goals, missing key details and stakeholder involvement.
- **Ideal Scenario:** Detailed discussion with Flight Simulators, Inc., defining goals, gathering stakeholders, identifying skill sets, timeline, cost, and value.
- Proposal presented to leadership, approved, and submitted to Flight Simulators, Inc.

**2. Making a Plan:**

- **Rushed Scenario:** Lack of detailed planning, resulting in platform incompatibility.
- **Ideal Scenario:** Green light to work on the project leads to a comprehensive plan.
- Jason outlines deadlines, tasks, schedule, and ensures resource preparedness.

**3. Executing and Completing Tasks:**

- **Rushed Scenario:** Lack of monitoring, quality expectations, and communication.
- **Ideal Scenario:** Jason's team executes the plan, monitored by Jason, who removes barriers, communicates, and keeps stakeholders updated.

**4. Closing the Project:**

- **Rushed Scenario:** Project fails before closing due to platform issues.
- **Ideal Scenario:** Successful completion; lessons learned documented; team celebration organized by Jason.

## Project Management Approaches

- **Linear Projects:**
	- Ideal for projects with clearly defined phases, tasks, and limited changes.
	- Clear sequential process. Phases or tasks must be completed sequentially.
	- Need the blueprint before laying the foundation. Minimal changes during development.
	- Stick to the plan to meet criteria.
	- Example: Manufacturing, construction, event planning.
- **Iterative Projects**
	- Suited for projects with uncertainty, requiring regular feedback and adjustments.
	- More flexibility, anticipate changes. Tasks can happen simultaneously.
	- Test and adjust as you go. Adjustments made as needed, even to the overall goal.
	- Deliver parts of the project incrementally.
	- Example: Building a website, delivering parts in sprints for early feedback and adjustments.

## Lean (**Quản** Trị Tinh gọn)

- Originated in manufacturing, focusing on waste removal.
- 8 types of waste: defects, excess processing, overproduction, waiting, inventory, transportation, motion, non-utilized talent.
- **5S quality tool:**
	1. **Sort:** Remove all items not needed for current production operations and leave only the bare essentials. 
	2. **Set in order:** Arrange needed items so that they are easy to use. Label items so that anyone can find them or put them away. 
	3. **Shine:** Keep everything in the correct place. Clean your workspace every day.
	4. **Standardize:** Perform the process in the same way every time. 
	5. **Sustain:** Make a habit of maintaining correct procedures and instill this discipline in your team.
- Lean uses a **Kanban** scheduling system to manage production.

## Six Sigma (**Quản lý** Chất Lượng Dự án)

- Aims to reduce variations, ensuring quality processes consistently.
- Originates from statistics, representing 99.9996% quality.
- Use this methodology to find aspects of the product or process that are **_measurable_ like time, cost, or quantity**. Any process that created unacceptable products has to be improved upon.
- **The seven key principles of Six Sigma are**:
	1. Always focus on the customer.
	2. Identify and understand how the work gets done. Understand how work really happens.
	3. Make your processes flow smoothly.
	4. Reduce waste and concentrate on value.
	5. Stop defects by removing variation.
	6. Involve and collaborate with your team.
	7. Approach improvement activity in a systematic way.

### Lean Six Sigma

- Combination of Lean and Six Sigma.
- Common in projects aiming to save money, improve quality, and streamline processes.
- Components include 5S, DMAIC, and Kanban.
- **DMAIC is a strategy for process improvement.** (You have your processes, how do you improve them?)
- Useful for **improving sales, conversions, or eliminating bottlenecks in processes**.
- Five phases: Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control (DMAIC).
- **DMAIC Phases:**
	1. **Define:**
		- Similar to the initiation phase in traditional project management.
		- Define project goals and stakeholder expectations.
	2. **Measure:**
		- Focus on data.
		- Map out the current process and identify problems.
		- Set plans for data collection and measurement frequency.
	3. **Analyze:**
		- Identify gaps and issues based on data analysis.
		- Understand causes and solutions.
	 4. **Improve:**
		- Make improvements based on careful analysis.
		- Modify processes to address identified issues.
	5. **Control:**
		- Implement new processes and documentation.
		- Continuously monitor to prevent a return to old, inefficient methods.
