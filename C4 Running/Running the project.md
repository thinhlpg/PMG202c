- **Mitigation Plans for High-Impact Risks **
	- For high-impact risks, even with low probability, have a mitigation plan.
	- Address how to handle the risk if it materializes.
- **ROAM Technique for Managing Risks After Materialization**
	- ROAM technique: Resolved, Owned, Accepted, and Mitigated.
	- Resolved: If the risk is eliminated and won't be a problem.
	- Owned: Team member takes ownership and monitors the risk.
	- Accepted: Agreed that nothing will be done about the risk.
	- Mitigated: Action taken to reduce likelihood or impact.
- **Prioritization and Discussion**
	- After categorizing risks, the team discusses and prioritizes them.
	- Differentiate risks and issues.
- **Closing and Next Steps**
	- Unforeseen risks may still arise.
	- Learn about sharing risks with stakeholders and the escalation technique in the next video.

## **Case Study: Using Risk Management Tools**

- **Project Overview: Paw Snacks Puppy Treats**
	- Online retailer of pet treats
	- Three years of growth, expanding to a new line of treats for puppies
- **The Issue: Delay in Cookie Cutter Delivery**

	- Mitigation plan approved by project sponsor and stakeholders
- **Managing the Issue: Consulting the Mitigation Plan**
	- Abe identifies two options for handling the risk
		1. Increase the number of treats produced with the existing bakery
		2. Place an order with a second bakery to speed up production
	- Naja and Abe choose option one to avoid involving a second bakery
- **Evaluation of the New Plan and Risks**
	- Naja and Abe brainstorm potential risks associated with option one
	- Determine that a smaller order of treats may have a minor impact on projected growth
	- Decide to accept the risk to avoid further project delays
- **Communication with Stakeholders**
	- Naja requests a meeting with the project sponsor
	- Communicates the adjusted plan, outlines the growth-related risk, and recommends accepting the risk
	- Project sponsor approves the new plan
- **Execution of the Adjusted Plan**
	- Abe communicates the plan to the bakery manager
	- Baking begins two days behind schedule
	- The project team is prepared to launch the new line on time
- **Pro Tip: Mitigation Plan vs. Contingency Plan**
	- Mitigation plan: Planned risk response strategy
	- Contingency plan: Funds set aside outside the planned budget to support risk response plans or manage unforeseen risks during

## The Steps of a Retrospective

1. **Project Summary**

Before the meeting, Tessa fills in the basic project information:

- Goals and objectives
- Duration
- Team members
- Methodology

Tessa also includes links to key documents including the project charter, production plan, and scene requirements.

 1. **Key accomplishments**

Tessa wants to begin the meeting on a positive note by encouraging the team to ==list out what went well==. They are most proud of the anti-gravity effects they added to the scene, as well as the collaborative dedication that they each put into the process. The team also thanked Tessa for their meticulous note taking and project documentation.

1. **Lessons learned**

The team also ==discusses things that need improvement==, as well as instances when they were fortunate that things went in their favor. They missed some opportunities early on to research what life in space is really like, and that slowed down the process of developing the right effects. The deadline for the scene also shifted out one month, which was a lucky break for their timeline.

1. **Action items**
After the team lists out their lessons learned, Tessa asks them to ==turn their lessons into action items==. They agree to ==create a list of space experts to consult== with on an ongoing basis, and they want to book time in a reduced gravity aircraft so they can experience weightlessness first-hand. Two team members volunteer to work on these action items.

2. **Future considerations**

Now, Tessa asks the team to think about the ==next scenes on their list, and the risks that could come up and impede their success==. The team identifies specific considerations for their research process, timeline, and team dynamic. Tessa notes these as items for further mitigation plans.

1. **Resources and notes**

Since this retrospective will serve as a reference for how the project went and what it accomplished, Tessa adds the project notes which the team said they found valuable. They also include the names of vendors and software that the team used to create the special effects.
