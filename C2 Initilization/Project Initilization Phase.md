# Initiation Process

- Initiation marks the beginning of the project life cycle.
- Begins after identifying a problem or opportunity within the organization.
- Often initiated by senior leaders to address specific business needs (business cases).
- Responsibilities of a project manager:
	- Identify project goals, resources, and details.
	- Collaborate with stakeholders.
	- Ensure all essential components come together for project success.
- Deliverable in this phase: a project charter.

## Key Activities in Initiation

- Asking stakeholders the right questions.
- Performing research.
- Determining resources.
- Documenting key project components.
- Aids in solidifying the project's scope or boundary


# Cost-Benefit Analysis

- Key questions for benefits:
	- What value will the project create?
	- How much money could it save?
	- How much revenue from existing customers?
	- How much time will be saved?
	- How will the user experience improve?
- **Cost Determination Questions:**
	- How much time will people spend on the project?
	- What are the one-time costs?
	- Are there ongoing costs?
	- What about long-term costs?
- **Balancing Benefits and Costs:**
- Benefits should always outweigh costs.
- Early consideration of these questions is crucia

# 6 Key Components of Initilization Phase

1. **Goals:**
	- Definition: Clear objectives set by senior leaders or project managers.
	- What the project aims to achieve?
	- Examples:
		- Improve response time to customer inquiries via email by 20%.
		- Increase revenue by 5% through a new service, Plant Pals.
2. **Scope:**
	- What should or shouldn’t be included in the project?
	- Scope includes project boundaries, end users, complexity, timeline, budget, and resources.
3. **Deliverables:**
	- Definition: Products or services created for customers, clients, or sponsors.
	- Nature: Tangible or intangible outcomes supporting project goals.
	- **Decision and Accountability:** Usually decided upfront with stakeholders or clients.
	- Examples from the Office Green project: Email templates, Plant service launch, Website highlighting new plants.
4. **Success Criteria:**
	- Definition: Standards to measure project success in goal attainment.
	- Significance: Establishes benchmarks and evaluation parameters.
5. **Stakeholders:**
	- Definition: Individuals with an interest in and impact on the project.
	- Role: Influential in determining goals, objectives, and project expectations.
6. **Resources:**
	- Definition: Budget, people, materials, and other assets available for the project.
	- Consideration: Critical planning for adequate resources from the beginning.

## **Ensuring Well-Defined Goals:**

- **Review and Alignment:** Regularly review goals and ensure alignment with stakeholders' vision.
- Discussion with stakeholders to understand the project's larger goals and mission.
- Avoiding issues by gaining stakeholder support for project goals.

## Example

- During these meetings, you organized your thoughts by writing down project key components that the stakeholders have requested. Your notes on the key components are:
	- $150,000 maximum budget  
	- Team: can add one member from the school IT department  
	- Platform should allow teachers to enter grades and allow students/parents to view grades  
	- Need full teacher buy-in at high school: 100% adoption within next nine months   
	- Project should focus only on the digital grading platform and NOT impact other digital platforms (ex. attendance, school lunch payments)  
	- Overall, the school is seeking a platform for digital grading
- Goal: To launch a digital grading platform for the high school and get full teacher adoption.
- Scope: Creating the digital grading platform and not updating other digital platforms the school uses such as attendance or meal payments.
- Deliverable: A platform for teachers to enter grades and students to view their grades.
- Success criteria: 100% of teachers adopt the digital grading platform within the next nine months.
- Stakeholders: teachers, students, parents, school administrators, school IT department, and the district superintendent.
- Resources: the budget of $150,000 and the member from the school’s IT department.

# **SMART Goals Method**

## Definition

- **Specific:** The objective has no ambiguity for the project team to misinterpret.
	- What do I want to accomplish?
	- Why is this a goal?
	- Who is involved?
	- Where should the goal be delivered?
	- To what degree?
- **Measurable:** Metrics help the project team determine when the objective is met.
	- Ask questions like how much, how many, and how will I know when it's accomplished?
	- Metrics are essential for measurement.
	- Example: Office Green's goal to increase revenue by five percent.
	- Example: measure engineers’ productivity, such as a particular number of features created per engineer or a specific number of issues flagged per day.
- **Attainable:** The project team agrees the objective is realistic.
	- Encourage growth but not too extreme.
	- Breaking down the goal into smaller parts helps in understanding attainability.
	- Example: Running a 5K – increasing distance gradually is more attainable than winning the race.
- **Relevant:** Goals should make sense and align with other goals, priorities, and values.
	- Consider the effort versus benefits.
	- Align with the organization's needs and priorities.
	- Consider the timing – economic and social contexts.
	- Ensure support from all stakeholders.
- **Time-Bound:** Goals should have a deadline.
	- Deadlines help track progress.
	- Time and metrics often go hand in hand.
	- Example: Breaking down revenue increase goals over quarters, months, and weeks.
![[Smart Goal Method.png]]

## Example

- **Goal**: _“Office Green will soon create an app to help customers care for their plants.”_
- **SMART Goal**: _“Office Green will create an app to help customers care for their plants. The app will offers tips and reminders. It will be compatible with 100% of the types of plants Office Green sells and will be completed within 18 months.”_
- **Specific:** The team knows what they’re building: an app that helps users care for their plants and reminds them to do so. 
- **Measurable:** The app will be complete when it includes 100% of the plant types Office Green sells.
- **Attainable:** The company has the knowledge, time, resources to build the app. 
- **Relevant:** Office Green’s business model relies on customers caring for their plants successfully. 
- **Time-bound:** The goal includes an 18-month timeframe.

# Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)

- **Objective** defines the desired result or outcome.
- **Key Results** are measurable outcomes determining when the objective is met. Try to **develop around 2–-3  key results for each objective**. Up to maxium of 5 KR. They can and should be revised as you make progress, so it’s okay if you need to adjust your key results later on.
- **Example**:
	- O1: Successfully launch version 2.0 of our early learning app.
		- KR1: 15,000 new downloads within first quarter post launch
		- KR2: 75,000 new downloads within first year post launch
		- KR3: 25% of monthly downloads from new customers
	- O2: Bla bla bla bla.
		- KR1: 24 bla bla
		- KR2: 123 bla bla
		- KR3: 242% bla bla
- Effective objectives are:
	- **Aspirational:** Is the objective challenging and inspiring?
	- **Aligned with company goals:** Does the objective support company and/or departmental OKRs?
	- **Action-oriented:** Does the objective motivate the team to take initiative?
	- **Concrete:** Can the project team easily grasp the objective?
	- **Significant:** Will achieving the objective make a meaningful impact or change from where you are currently?
- Effective Key Reults are:
	- Measureable
	- Specific and time-bound
	- **Ambitious** (meanwhile in SMART, it is attainable) yet realistic
- **Company-Level OKRs:**
	- Shared across the organization.
	- Updated annually.
	- Support the mission of the organization.
	- Example: Increase customer retention by adapting to the changing workplace environment.
- **Project-Level OKRs:**
	- Set during initiation phase.
	- Aligned with company and department-level OKRs.
	- Tracked throughout planning and execution.
	- Example: Project objective for Plant Pals - Enroll existing customers in the Plant Pals service.
- **Department/Team-Level OKRs:**
	- Support broader company OKRs.
	- More specific to the team's job function.
	- Example: Sales department objective - Increase the sales team presence nationwide.

# SMART Vs OKR

- Source: [SMART Goals vs. OKRs | Smartsheet](https://www.smartsheet.com/content/okr-vs-smart-goals)
- OKRs are typically both less specific and more aspirational than SMART goals, and as such, they often encourage the journey toward cultural change or a breakthrough development.
- Organizations tend to set SMART goals annually (although some do this quarterly) and OKRs on quarterly or monthly cycles, which makes them more agile than SMART goals.
- **Adaptability:** 
	- With a typical annual cadence, SMART goals offer little opportunity to pivot. They work well with a clearly defined target in fixed circumstances.
	- By contrast, with quarterly cadences for teams and individuals and broader objectives, OKRs permit changing key results to adjust for changes, such as in the competitor landscape.
- **Aspirational Expansiveness:** 
	- OKRs have a reputation for encouraging fearless exploration of new alternatives.
	- A SMART goal may promote work toward achieving a specific purpose, after which people start to coast, thus limiting expansion and higher corporate and personal success. On the other hand, SMART goals fix focus on attainable aims.
- **Morale:** The narrow focus of a SMART goal may cause employees to disregard other profitable work to meet a goal. When people fail to achieve a goal, they may be demoralized because they can't see the big picture of their total accomplishments.
- - **Planning:** Because of the specificity of SMART goals, they may take longer to create.

# Project Scope (Phạm Vi Dự án)

- **In-scope tasks:** Contribute to the project's overall goal.
- **Out-of-scope tasks:** Not part of the project plan.
- Project manager's role: Set and maintain firm boundaries for the project.

## Scope Creep (Mất Kiểm Soát Phạm Vi Dự án)

![[Project Initilization Phase.png]]

- Changes, growth, or uncontrolled factors affecting project scope after initiation.
- Common challenge in project management.
- Example: Expanding a mobile keyboard app update project to include designing keyboards for other languages.

## Scope Change and Scope Gap

Khác với scope creep, **scope change** là quá trình thay đổi phạm vi dự án một cách chính thức, được thống nhất bởi quản lý dự án và khách hàng. **Scope gap** diễn ra khi khi yêu cầu của khách hàng và nội dung nhóm thực hiện dự án ghi nhận không đồng nhất, hay nói cách khác là do giao tiếp không hiệu quả.

## **Identifying And Managing Scope Creep:**

- **Sources of Scope Creep:**
	1. **External:** Changes from customers, shifts in the business environment, or technological changes.
	2. **Internal:** Changes suggested or insisted upon by project team members.
- **Tips to Combat Scope Creep:**
	- Ensure stakeholders have visibility into the project.
	- Get **clarity** on requirements before formal approval.
	- Set **ground rule**s and expectations for stakeholder involvement.
	- Document agreements in writing.
	- **Develop a plan for dealing with out-of-scope requests**.
	- Agree on who can make formal change requests and the evaluation process.
- **Leading Causes of External Scope Creep:**
	- Lack of clarity on requirements before defining the scope.
	- Importance of specific, measurable goals, deliverables, processes, and milestones.
- **Internal Scope Creep:**
	- Comes from project team members suggesting or insisting on changes.
	- Emphasize that any change outside the project scope affects the bottom line, schedule, and increases risk.

## Triple Constraint Model (Bộ Ba Ràng buộc) #framework

![[The Tripple Constraint.png]]

- Decision-making involves ==trade-offs among scope, time, and cost==.
- Essential for ==evaluating scope changes==.
- Changes in one constraint affect the others; understanding these relationships is crucial.
- Changes must be justified and approved by project sponsors and stakeholders.**

1. **Managing Time and Cost Alongside Scope:**
	- Time involves the project schedule and deadlines.
	- Cost includes the budget and resources.
	- Changes in one constraint necessitate changes in the others.
2. **Understanding Project Priorities:**
	- Clear understanding of priorities for scope, time, and cost.
	- Trade-offs depend on project priorities and goals.
3. **Scenario Analysis (Examples):**
	- Scenario 1: Scope change request to improve product features; extend timeline without increasing the budget.
	- Scenario 2: Reduce the budget without changing the scope; may require extending the timeline.
	- Scenario 3: Tighten the timeline without increasing the budget; make changes to scope, like limiting shipping options.
	- Scenario 4: Meet the project deadline as the top priority; stakeholders willing to increase the budget and adjust scope.

### Apply Tripple Constrants Example

- Original:
	- Budget 800,000
	- Scope: 8 weeks field research and synthesizing result report, 3-days workshop
	- 5 teamates
- Situation 1: reduce budget to 650000
	- → have a 1-day workshop instead of a 3-day workshop
	- → or just deliver the report, no workshop (save time and money to organize the workshop)
- Situation 2: Recruiting for field research will take a week longer than expected (9 weeks).
	- → increase buget to hire more employees
	- → eliminate sections in the research report, you could save time. Or, similar to the example above, cut the workshop to a 1-day workshop to meet the deadline
- Situation 3: Customer want to include details on the market opportunities for new product ideas, technical constraints, and design considerations (increase scope)
	- → increase budget to hire more reseacher, keep the time.
	- → decrease the time for the research to have time to do additional things.

## Scope Management Best Practices

1. **Define Project Requirements:**
	- **Communicate** with stakeholders to document project requirements during the initiation phase.
	- Clearly **understand and document** what stakeholders want from the project.
2. **Set a Clear Project Schedule:**
	- Essential for adhering to project scope.
	- **Outline all requirements and necessary tasks** in the project schedule.
3. **Determine Out-of-Scope Items:**
	- Ensure stakeholders and the project team recognize when proposed changes are out of scope.
	- Reach a clear agreement on potential impacts and document it.
4. **Provide Alternatives:**
	- Suggest alternative solutions to stakeholders.
	- Help stakeholders understand the risks associated with proposed changes.
	- Conduct a cost-benefit analysis, if needed.
5. **Establish Change Control Process:**
	- Inevitable changes should follow a defined process for definition, review, and approval.
	- Ensure project team awareness of the change control process.
6. **Learn to Say No:**
	- Be prepared to say no to proposed changes that could impact the project's scope, budget, timeline, or resources.
	- Clearly communicate the implications of additional tasks.
7. **Collect Costs for Out-of-Scope Work:**
	- Document all costs incurred for out-of-scope work.
	- Include costs for work indirectly impacted by increased scope.
	- Clearly indicate the purpose of charges.

# Defining Success Criteria and Measuring Success

1. **Complex but Crucial Process:**
	- Defining project success is a ==complex but crucial== part of project management.
	- ==Practice and experience== will make this process more natural in planning and throughout the project.
2. **Process for Determining Success Criteria:**
	- Use the ==SMART== goals framework to define measurable success criteria.
	- Project success is determined by:
		- Product quality: features, quality, unit cost, and usability.
			- Track implementation of priority requirements.
			- Assess the number of technical issues or defects.
			- Measure the percentage of features delivered at the project end.
		- Customer needs fulfillment and Stakeholder expectations
			- Use [[Engagement Metric]]
			- Use [[Adoptation Metric]]
			- Measure satisfaction through surveys
- **Document, Align, and Communicate Success:**
	1. ==Obtain clarity== from stakeholders on project requirements and expectations.
	2. Seek answers to questions like: ==Who defines success? What criteria determine success?==
	- Get key stakeholders or the steering committee to ==review and approve success criteria==.
	- Continuous access and alignment to ==prevent scope creep== and meet expectations.
	- Document success criteria upfront. ==Keep the documentation visible== and communicate it clearly with the team throughout the project.
1. **Creating Success Criteria - Office Green Project Example:**
	- Goal: Increase revenue by 5% by the end of the year.
	- Deliverable: Website with a gallery of plant selections.
	- Develop a process for measuring success throughout the project life cycle.
![[Success-Criteria-Template.docx]]

## Project Launch Vs Land

1. **Project Launch vs. Project Landing:**
	- **Launch:** Delivering the final results of the project to the client or user.
	- **Land:** Achieving a measure of success, marked by assessing results and meeting success criteria.
2. **Importance of Landing:**
	- Launching is not the endpoint; landing is where true success is achieved.
	- Landings are the ultimate reward for project managers, signifying project success.
3. **Goals Beyond Launch:**
	- Clearly define measurable goals beyond just launching the project.
	- Examples include increasing retention or speeding up a product feature.
4. **Example Scenario - Eco-Friendly Organization:**
	- Develop a recycling education program with a goal to increase recycling by 20% in five years.
	- Launch: Handing over the training program to the school district.
	- Landing: Periodically assessing over the next five years if the program achieves the 20% recycling increase.
5. **Avoiding "Launch and Forget":**
	- Common mistake is neglecting to assess project deliverables after client acceptance.
	- Periodic assessments ensure that the project not only launches but also lands successfully.
6. **Tandem Work of Launching and Landing:**
	- Launching and landings work together to ensure true project success.
	- A successful landing enhances alignment within teams and provides better visibility on achieving success.
7. **Post-Launch Assessment:**
	- A project landing doesn't create more hurdles if done correctly.
	- It creates greater alignment within teams and offers visibility on achieving success.
8. **Key Takeaway - Remember to Land:**
	- While launching is a significant moment, the true success is in landing.
	- Regularly assess results, communicate with the team, meet with the client, and refer to intended deliverables and metrics for a comprehensive measurement of success.

## Communicating and Tracking OKRs

1. **Regular Check-Ins:**
	- Conduct regular check-ins to track progress and resolve issues promptly. (progress report meeting)
2. **Share with the Team:**
	- Communicate OKRs to the team to align efforts and focus.
	- Share through digital documents, meetings, or internal websites.
3. **Assign Owners:**
	- Assign an owner to each key result for clarity and accountability.

**Measuring Progress:**

1. **Scoring OKRs:**
	- Scores or grades don't provide a complete assessment but help gauge proximity to objectives.
	- Scores can be based on a percentage, completion of milestones, a scale of 1 to 10, or a "traffic light" system.
2. **Yes/No Method:**
	- A key result is graded as 1 (achieved) or 0 (not achieved).
3. **Scale Grading:**
	- Key results can be graded on a scale (e.g., 0.0 to 1.0 at Google).
	- Aim for an average score, e.g., 0.6 to 0.7, or 60–70% for ambitious yet achievable goals.
4. **Setting Expectations:**
	- Ambitious OKRs are encouraged, aiming for an average score as per set expectations.
5. **Schedule Checkpoints:**
	- Regularly communicate OKR progress to the team and senior managers.
	- Monthly check-ins and end-of-quarter evaluations are common practices.
![[OKRs-Scorecard-Spreadsheet.xlsx]]

## Bussiness Metrics

1. **Adoption Metrics:** #metric
	- Adoption metrics measure how customers use or adopt a product without issues.
	- Examples:
		- Number of User Sign-ups/Registrations
		- Number of App Downloads
		- Account Activation Rate
2. **Engagement Metrics**:
	- Engagement metrics measure the frequency and meaningfulness of customer interaction.
	- Examples:
		- **Number of Daily Active Users (DAU)**: number of ==unique== users who ==open== the application within a ==24 Hours timeframe==.
		- **Session Duration**: The average amount of time users spend within a single session.
		- **Feature Interaction**: the usage of specific features within the app
		- **Retention Rate**: percentage of users who continue to use the app over time
		- **Social Sharing Activity**
		- **In-App Purchases**: the number and value of transactions within the app
3. **Customer Satisfaction Score**
	- CSAT measures the level of satisfaction customers have with a product or service, typically expressed as a percentage.
	- Example:
		- **Customer Survey**: How satisfied are you with this app (scale from 1-5 or 1-10)
		- **In-App Ratings
		- **Reviews and Comments**. Analyze the sentiment of reviews and extract valuable insights from comments
		- **User Interviews**: Conduct one-on-one interviews with a subset of users. Ask their experiences, preferences, and suggestions for improvement.
4. **Tracking Metrics:**
	- Evaluate tools to track metrics effectively.
	- ==Use spreadsheets or dashboards for business metrics like revenue.==
	- Utilize project management tools for efficiency metrics and progress tracking.

## Why Projects Fail: Initiation Missteps

- **Unrealistic Expectations:**
	- Agreeing to unrealistic expectations can lead to project failure.
	- Rushing projects without adequate resources results in quality issues.
	- Avoid committing to firm deadlines during initiation to prevent unrealistic expectations.
- **Miscommunication:**
	- Timely and clear communication is crucial for project success.
	- ==Stakeholder analysis and RACI charts help formulate effective communication strategies==.
	- Setting expectations for communication methods early is essential.
- **Lack Of Resources**
	- ==Resources include team members, budget, and materials==.
	- Lack of proper planning can lead to over-tasked or depleted resources.
	- Project managers should account for team members' workload, skill sets, and budget constraints.
- **Scope Creep**
	- Scope defines project work and deliverables.
	- Scope changes, if not captured, can lead to project failure.
	- Example: Unplanned additional deliverables without adjusting schedule, budget, or resources.

# Cost-Benefit-Budget Analysis

- Evaluation of project benefits vs. dollar costs.
- **Benefits:**
	1. Value created.
	2. Money saved or generated.
	3. Time saved.
	4. Improved customer experience.
- **Costs:**
	1. Time spent.
	2. One-time costs.
	3. Ongoing costs.
	4. Long-term costs.
- **Intangible Benefits:**
	1. Customer satisfaction.
	2. Employee satisfaction and morale.
	3. Employee productivity.
	4. Brand perception and recognition.
- **Intangible Costs:**
	1. Risks to customer retention, employee satisfaction, or brand perception.
- **Calculating Costs and Benefits:**
	- Also known as calculating **Return on Investment** (ROI $$ROI = (G-C)/C$$
	- **Example:** $10,000 gains, $6,300 costs → ROI = (10000 - 6300)/6300 = 58.7%

# Tools for Stakeholder Management

## Stakeholder Analysis (Phân Tích Các Bên Liên quan)

### Definition

- A tool to identify and analyze stakeholders, understanding their influence and interests.
- Helps in tailoring communication and engagement strategies based on stakeholder characteristics.

### Steps for Stakeholder Analysis

- _Step 1:_ Make a list of all stakeholders impacted by the project.
	- Primary (direct impact)
	- Secondary (indirect impact)
- _Step 2:_ Determine the level of interest and influence for each stakeholder.
	- Ask stakeholers questions.
	- **Influence:** Measures the power a stakeholder has and how their actions affect project outcomes. Consider within the project only, not the company or organization.
	- **Interest:** How involved is each stakeholder in the project on a daily basis? How much will the project impact the needs of each stakeholder?
- _Step 3:_ Assess their ability to participate and find ways to involve them.
- **Power Grid:**
	- Two-by-two grid measuring interest and influence.
	- Determines stakeholder importance to project success.
	- _Key Players (Top Right Corner):_ Closely partner with them for desired outcomes.
	- _Consulting Stakeholders (Top Left Corner):_ Consult and meet their needs; their opinions are crucial.
	- _Keeping Informed (Right Bottom Corner):_ Keep them updated on the project; show consideration.
	- _Monitor (Bottom Left Corner):_ Least important for this project; keep them informed.
	- ![[Power Grid.png]]
- **Steering Committee:**
	- Comprising high influence and high-interest stakeholders. (sponors, investor, CEO,…)
	- Senior decision-making body with authority over budget, timeline, and scope changes.
	- Project manager brings project information for decision-making.
![[Stakeholder-analysis-and-power-grid.pptx]]
![[Stakeholder-analysis-and-power-grid-answer.pptx]]

### Ask Stakeholders Example

- What Can I Clarify for You? Do You Have Concerns? Landscape/Web Designer: I understand how Plant Pals supports our overall business goals, but I worry how my role might change if Office Green shifts from general landscaping to potted plants.
- What Does Project Success Mean to You? Landscape/Web Designer: Ideally, Plant Pals will help us expand our business without neglecting our core offerings. I’ve been at Office Green since the start; I want it to succeed, but I also want to keep doing the work I love.
- ==How Would You like to Be Involved in This Project?== Receptionist: I know ==you don’t need me for day-to-day planning==, but I am really ==interested== in this new part of the business. Plus, I’m sure our customers will have a lot of questions, so I want to understand how Plant Pals works.
- Can You Share Any Insights from Your ==Experience== with Customers? Receptionist: I know a lot of our customers are enthusiastic about the new service, but they don’t always respond well to change. Make sure you communicate well, and be ready to support them after launch. I can help with that. (this question is for consultant role in RACI Chart)
- What Are Your Expectations for the Project? Director of Product: I’m busy with too many projects to be involved day-to-day. But beyond our main project goals, I hope it sets us up to expand to more cities and helps fund new initiatives.
- And where Do You Think I’ll Get Support? Meet Resistance? Director of Product: We have some excited customers—they’ve been asking for this for a while. Our investors are supportive, but more cautious. You should meet with our Landscape Designer. I know they’re on your team, but they might have some concerns.

## RACI Chart

![[RACI Chart 1.png]]

![[RACI Chart example.png]]

- **Types of Roles in a RACI Chart:**
	- **Responsible:**
		- Those doing the work to complete the task.
		- Best practice: Limit the number of team members for this role.
	- **Accountable:**
		- The person ensuring the task is done.
		- ==Only one individual should be accountable for each task==.
		- Has the authority to approve the work.
	- **Consulted:**
		- Those giving input and feedback ==before== decision or action is taken, such as subject matter experts or decision-makers.
		- No set minimum or maximum; each person should have a relevant reason for being consulted.
	- **Informed:**
		- Those needing to know the final decisions or that a task is complete ==(after)==.
		- Multiple people can be in the "informed" role.
		- They require status updates but do not provide direct feedback.
- **Chart Format:**
	- A table format is commonly used for RACI charts.
	- Roles/people are listed across the top, and tasks/deliverables are listed on the left.
- **Example in Project Management:**
	- For the launch of Office Green's new service, tasks include creating different price points.
	- The Head of Finance is accountable, the Financial Analyst is responsible, the Director of Product is consulted, and the sales team members need to be informed.
- **Avoiding Confusion with RACI:**
	- Prevent confusion by ensuring ==only one person is designated as "accountable."==
	- Address factors that can cause confusion, such as unbalanced workloads, unclear hierarchy, overlapping work, and excessive communication.
- **Benefits of RACI Analysis:**
	- Resolves and prevents confusion.
	- Ensures a clear understanding of roles and responsibilities.
	- Contributes to the success of the project by being proactive.

# Project Team

## Build a Team

- Putting together the right team involves careful consideration of ==team size, skills, availability, and motivation==.
- ==First thing to do is list out all the roles requried to complete the project==.
- **Team size** base on project compexlity.
- **Technical Skills**:
	- Project manager ensures that team members possess the required skills for their assigned tasks
	- Skills can be taught, and positive attributes are also valuable
- **Soft skills**:
	- Interpersonal or soft skills like patience and conflict mediation are equally important.
	- Problem-solving skills
	- Leadership skills
- **Availability and Motivation**:
	- ==Availability of team members is a factor in decision-making==. Especially in [[Matrix organizations]] where individuals may have multiple bosses.
	- Motivated individuals contribute to the overall success of the project.
	- Whether pre-assigned or volunteers
	- Project Manager: ==Positive engagement and maintaining a positive outlook during challenges== contribute to team motivation.
- ==Trust is crucial==, and dedicating time early in the team-building process helps develop it.

## Project Roles: Understanding the Key Players

![[Project Initilization Phase .excalidraw]]

- **Roles on a Project:**
	- Roles may not be fixed; team members may need to adapt and take on multiple roles, especially in small or resource-limited companies.
	- Core project roles include Project Sponsors, Team Members, Customers or Users, Stakeholders, and the Project Manager.
1. **Project Sponsor:**
	- A project sponsor is typically a senior executive or leader within an organization.
	- Initiates the project, presents a business case, ==signs the project charter==, ==releases resources== and may ==fund the project.==
	- Crucial for project success; frequent communication with the sponsor is critical.
	- Example: C levels officiers, Director of Product, Investors, Government Official,…
2. **Team Members:**
	- The heart of the operation, responsible for day-to-day work, and making the project happen.
3. **Customers or Users:**
	- Customers get value from a successfully landed project, defining project requirements.
	- Users are those who ultimately use the product produced by the project.
4. **Stakeholders:**
	- Anyone involved in the project with a vested interest in its success.
	- Primary stakeholders directly benefit, while secondary stakeholders have an indirect impact.
	- **Primary Stakeholders:**
		- Directly affected by the project's outcome.
		- Examples: Team members, senior leaders, customers.
